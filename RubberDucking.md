# 🦆 Rubber Ducking

[🔙 to the lesson](./README.md)

### Walking Before We Run

In order to sprint, you must be able to run. And in order to run you must be able to walk.  
**We are still at the walking stage of coding.**

[Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) is really taking off in the industry - but in order to be successfull with _vibe coding_ you must be a software engineer (or at least _really_ good at reading and debugging complex code that utilizes many architectures.

### Walking With AI

As a lead-in to coding with AI, we can start using simplified AI tools that act as a coding partner. The only such tool you are permitted to use at this time is the [CS50.ai Rubber Duck companion](https://cs50.ai/chat).

Using this tool, you can bounce ideas, debug code, and learn new coding terminology or data structures to assist you in your goal of _coding supremecy_. Again - **this is the _only_ assistive tool you are permitted to use**.

If you have questions or you feel the need to cheat - it is best to talk to your teacher _now_.
